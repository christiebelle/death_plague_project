	title: "What was the Black Death?",
	fact: "The Black Death was an epidemic in Europe from 1346-1350.",
	information: "The Black Death is the name given to the infectious disease that spread rapidly throughout Europe in the years from 1346-1350. Medieval doctors with limited knowledge had no idea how to stop, or treat it. It was incredibly contagious and could also be very quick; people could go to bed healthy and then be seriously ill the next day. It affected people living in the cities and the countryside, and 14th Century Europeans could not explain how it was spreading, and there was widespread panic. Many thought it was a punishment from God."
},
{
	title: "What were the symptoms?",
	fact: "There was 1 main symptom, followed by 6 others.",
	information: "The most obvious sign of the disease was swellings - usually in the armpits or the upper leg. These were also followed by fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, aches and finally terrible pain."
},
{
	title: "How did it spread?",
	fact: "It reached England in June 1348, Wales and Ireland in 1349 and Scotland in 1350.",
	information: "Rats. Most historians believe that the Black Death was caused by strains of the bubonic plague. The plague lived in fleas which lived on black rats. They gave the disease to the rats. When the rats died, the fleas hopped off onto humans."
},
{
	title: "Why did it spread?",
	fact: "It is estimated that 3.2 million people died in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland",
	information: "There were several reasons why it spread so quickly: Historians believe the plague originated in the Far East and travelled along the trade routes to Europe where there was very poor public health. Medieval towns were crowded and had no system of drains, sewers or rubbish collections. In such dirty conditions, rats lived and germs could grow. Also Bad harvests: after 1300, there was climate change and harvests failed. Also, during the Hundred Years' War armies used a tactic called 'chevauchée' where soldiers roamed around destroying houses and crops so it is possible that, when the plague hit, people were not as healthy and strong as they had been."
},
{
	title: "What was the death toll?",
	fact: "30-60% of the total population of Europe.",
	information: "The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of Europe's total population. Poor record keeping at the time makes it difficult to get a closer figure than this. Globally, it is also estimated the plague may have reduced the world population from around 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century. It would take around 200 years for the world population to recover from this."
},
{
	title: "Who/What were Plague doctors?",
	fact: "Medieval doctors believed the Black Death was caused by the movement of the planets.",
	information: "A plague doctor was a medic hired by cities to treat victims of the plague. Most of the time though, they were not trained professionals, lacked in knowledge and rarely cured any of their patients. They would attempt to treat victims by putting frogs or leeches on the swellings, or by burning herbs in the room, or making victims take baths of rosewater or vinegar."
},
{
	title: "Was there a cure?",
	fact: "Most people died 2-7 days after infection.",
	information: "At the time there was no known cure for the plague. Doctors were powerless to stop the outbreak. Some of the methods they used to try and cure the victims included sitting between two large fires, cooked onions, arsenic(poison), crushed emeralds, or even sitting in the sewer!"
},
{
	title: "What was Europe like before and after?",
	fact: "This instance of the Black Death died out in 1350.",
	information: "Before the outbreak of plague, most of the countries in Europe operated feudal systems. The majority of people were very poor and lived in overcrowded unpleasant conditions - especially in cities and towns. Most countries had busy trade routes with each other and the Near and Far East, but despite this there were still widespread food shortages and famine as a result of costly ongoing wars. After the epidemic people changed the way they thought about life - with some going on to lead wild and immoral lives, and others fell into despair. There was also a Europe wide wool shortage - as the Black Death had also killed off a lot of animals, including sheep. The poorest people began to hate being poor and reject the feudal system, and along with the shortage of workers, this lead to the peasants revolt and the end of feudalism."
},
{
	title: "Were there any more outbreaks?",
	fact: "The plague returned between 1361 and 1364, and 5 more times before 1405.",
	information: "There were actually many more outbreaks of the plague across Europe, and it is estimated the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. More well known outbreaks include the 1645 outbreak in Edinburgh, Scotland and the 1665 outbreak in London, England."
},
{
	title: "Where can I find out more?",
	fact: "The nursery rhyme 'Ring O'Roses' is thought to have originated from this outbreak of the plague, and details some of the symptoms such as the swellings and the chills.",
